# Computer-Vision
* This code is a Python script that uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to classify images using a pre-trained deep learning model (Inception V3) from TensorFlow Hub. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each part does:
* this code allows you to classify an image using a pre-trained deep learning model. You just need to specify the correct path to your image, and the script will output the predicted class index based on the model's predictions.
