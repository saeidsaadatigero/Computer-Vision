# Computer-Vision :computer:
### This code is a Python script that uses TensorFlow and OpenCV to classify images using a pre-trained deep learning model (Inception V3) from TensorFlow Hub. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each part does:
#### :pushpin:1-Import Libraries:
* cv2: OpenCV library for image processing.
* numpy: For numerical operations.
* tensorflow and tensorflow_hub: For loading and using the pre-trained model.
  
#### :pushpin:2-Load the Model:
*The model is loaded from TensorFlow Hub, specifically the Inception V3 model trained on the ImageNet dataset.

#### :pushpin:3-Define Functions:
* load_and_preprocess_image(image_path):

#### :pushpin:4-Loads an image from the specified path.
* Converts the image from BGR (OpenCV format) to RGB.
* Resizes the image to 299x299 pixels (required input size for Inception V3).
* Normalizes the pixel values to be between 0 and 1.
* Adds a batch dimension to the image (since the model expects input in batches).

#### :pushpin:5-predict_image(image_path):
* Calls the preprocessing function to prepare the image.
* Uses the model to make predictions on the processed image.
* Determines the predicted class by finding the index of the highest probability in the model's output.

#### :pushpin:6-Example Usage:
* The script sets a path for the image (image_path = '/content/IMG.jpg').
* It then tries to predict the class of the image using the predict_image function.
* If the image cannot be loaded, it raises a ValueError and prints an error message.

### this code allows you to classify an image using a pre-trained deep learning model. You just need to specify the correct path to your image, and the script will output the predicted class index based on the model's predictions.
